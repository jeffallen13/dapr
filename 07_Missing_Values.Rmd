Missing values and Imputation.

- try to move all information about missing values here 

Common ways: 

- Listwise deletion
- Mean imputation: advantage is does not introduce bias. 
- See Python for inspiration: imputing group means 
- Carry forward / backward: only appropriate for time series 
- Linear interpolation (time-based)
- Group-based regression (e.g., states, group-region)
- See ANR: ifelse(isna, predict from model)
- Sophisticated: mice, amelia, etc.
